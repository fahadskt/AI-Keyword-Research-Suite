# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
The project is currently in the development phase, with the core Keyword Research module fully implemented and functional. The focus is now on completing the remaining modules (Competitor Analysis, Content Strategy, Market Trends, and Local SEO) to achieve a fully functional application.

### Priority Areas
1. **Completing Competitor Analysis**: Implementing comprehensive competitor content and keyword analysis
2. **Enhancing Content Strategy Module**: Developing AI-driven content recommendations
3. **Refining Market Trends**: Improving trend detection and visualization
4. **Implementing Local SEO Module**: Building location-based keyword analysis

## Recent Changes
- Implemented the base Keyword Research module with AI integration
- Created the Settings page with API key management
- Set up the Local SEO module UI and basic functionality
- Added initial Market Trends visualizations
- Implemented the basic structure for Content Strategy module
- Added the Competitor Analysis foundation

## Next Steps
1. Implement content gap analysis in the Competitor Analysis module
2. Add content topic clustering in the Content Strategy module
3. Enhance trend visualization with interactive charts
4. Complete the location-based keyword analysis for Local SEO
5. Add more comprehensive error handling throughout the application
6. Implement export functionality for research results

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Technical Decisions Under Consideration
1. **Data Persistence**: Evaluating options for saving research results (localStorage vs. file exports)
2. **Performance Optimization**: Considering ways to optimize rendering for large datasets
3. **AI Provider Selection**: Evaluating which AI provider works best for different types of analysis

### UX Considerations
1. **Results Visualization**: Determining the most effective ways to present complex SEO data
2. **Loading States**: Improving feedback during API calls to enhance user experience
3. **Mobile Optimization**: Evaluating whether to optimize further for mobile users

### Feature Prioritization
1. Core functionality of each module must be completed first
2. Visualization and data presentation improvements are secondary
3. Export and sharing features will be implemented last

## Current Challenges
1. **AI Response Consistency**: Ensuring consistent format and quality across different AI providers
2. **Error Handling**: Gracefully handling API errors and rate limits
3. **Performance**: Managing performance with large datasets and complex visualizations
4. **JSON Parsing**: Properly parsing and validating AI-generated JSON responses
